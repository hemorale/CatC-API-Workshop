# CatC-API-Workshop
This is the code repository for Catalyst Center API Workshop v2.0
Last updated: March 31, 2025 by Hector Morales

This code repository has the following:
- Managed Campus Operations Guide, which contains in detail all the use cases structured for Catalyst Center headless operations
- Postman collections for the dCloud lab. They are structured from the easiest to the most complex deployments. These postman collections can be modified for your specific CatC deployment. But for the purpose of this lab, postman collections must be executed inside the dCloud lab.
- Python scripts for the use cases contained in the Managed Campus Operations Guide. These python scripts are flexible to run in your environment and we will use some of them for practicing some of the desired use cases.
- Presentation that contains step by step description of the workshop with all detailed instructions
- Modules, which are specific advanced python scripts
- RAG-enabled LLM example
